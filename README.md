<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a basic NetWork Settings when typing (ipcongfig /all) in the command prompt on your local computer. That walks you through the main network description under the "wireless lab adapter wi-fi" column, giving you a idea of who, what, when, where and why they are important. 

<br />




<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> 

<h2> NetWork Settings walk-through:</h2>
